# Nether Senpai

Using the magic of PHP-Parser and all the new features of 7.1, never manually
document a technical aspect of your code ever again.

However, you still can if you want. Using a comment format called Nether
Notation which I promise you will hate just because its different, you can
enhance and/or fill in more verbose aspects of the autogenerated documentation.

Bold claims I know for a repository that has little to nothing in it, but I have
been trying to pull this shit off for years now and PHP finally is ready for it.

# Requirements

- PHP 7.1
- Composer
